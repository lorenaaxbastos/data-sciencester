# Data Sciencester: Exploring "Data Science From Zero"

Being selected to participate in the Santander Coders bootcamp, a program offered by Ada Tech in collaboration with Santander Open Academy, comes with its perks. Participants receive a welcome box containing not only a sleek set of headphones and a thermal cup but also the fantastic book "Data Science From Zero," which was already on my wishlist.

I've created this repository to condense my notes and practice the concepts learned from reading this book.

## Why the name Data Sciencester?

To infuse excitement into the exploration of data science, Joel introduces a narrative that immerses readers in an imaginative scenario where they are recruited by a fictional company named DataSciencester â€” proprietor of a social network for data scientists. Within this context, a series of challenges is presented, prompting readers to apply fundamental data science concepts to solve problems.
